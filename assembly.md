# Assembling the House Wren Transcriptome using Trinity
This section focuses on generating the _de novo_ transcriptome assembly using the processed sequencing reads completed in the [previous section](./read_processing.md).  Afterwards, a series of cleaning, quality control, and annotation steps are performed prior to identifying SNPs.
