# Assembling the House Wren Transcriptome using Trinity
This section focuses on generating the _de novo_ transcriptome assembly using the processed sequencing reads completed in the [previous secion](./read_processing.md).  Afterwards, a series of cleaning, quality contnrol, and annotationn steps are performed prior to indetifying SNPs.
